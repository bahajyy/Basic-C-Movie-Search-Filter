You will code a movie search/filter console GUI with various operations.
The objectives you have to accomplish are listed below;

    * Create a Movie Class with private id(int),name(string),point(float),year(int) variables
    * Generate Getter for all variables and Setter for only point variable.
    * Read the "movie.txt" file and store each movie in Movie array.
    * Write necessary functionalities for the GUI options given in below;

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Welcome to the Movie Market. Please select an option.
    1 - Get movie details by ID
    2 - List movies between the years entered
    3 - Change the point of a movie
    4 - Get movie details starting with the entered letter
    5 - Exit
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Write a "printMovie" function to print movie details
    * Use "autoIncrement" logic to set ID values for Movie

    Bonus
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Add a "voting system" functionality for movies.
    * A movie can be voted up to 10 times with integer values between 1 and 10
    * The "point" value of the movie should be equal to the average of votes.
    * Be careful when you calculate the average
    (If a movie is voted for the first time, the average is  (original point value + new vote value) / 2 )
